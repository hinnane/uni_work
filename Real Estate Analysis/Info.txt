This project focuses on exploring and modeling a real estate dataset to understand the relationship between property prices and various influencing factors such as building age, year of sale, distance from the nearest MRT station, and number of convenience stores nearby. The analysis was conducted in R, employing techniques from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple forms of regression modeling.
