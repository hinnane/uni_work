Due to confidential information, I have changed the numbers appearing on these Power BI reports. These reports were created from scratch, linked to an Excel file that contained all the necessary data. The data was also cleaned and processed in Microsoft Access before being used in Power BI. This dashboard was designed to streamline monthly reporting — by simply updating the Excel file, all visualisations and metrics are automatically refreshed, saving significant time and ensuring data consistency across reports.
